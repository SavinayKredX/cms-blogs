What is a POS Transaction?
--------------------------

The process of concluding a purchase or sale at a physical or virtual point of sale is referred to as a POS transaction, or point of sale transaction. It entails the exchange of commodities, services, or both in exchange for money given by a client to a company. Usually, these transactions are facilitated and processed by a POS system.

In a POS transaction, the customer chooses the goods or services they want before moving on to the payment step. The company manages and processes the transaction using a point of sale system, which may comprise software and hardware such as cash registers, barcode scanners, or card readers.

There are several ways to pay for the purchase, including cash, credit or debit cards, mobile wallets, and electronic fund transfers. The customer receives a receipt when the POS system computes the total, applies any discounts or special offers, and prints the amount. When the payment is approved and successfully processed, the deal is deemed to be finished.

In order to track sales, manage inventory, and offer a seamless client experience, POS transactions are essential. They let organizations manage income, keep track of product sales, and expedite financial procedures. They are an essential component of day-to-day business operations in sectors including retail, hotel, and e-commerce.

At the end of the day, the cashier performed the POS transaction to complete the sale, and later, the manager conducted the POS reconciliation to ensure accurate records of all transactions. POS transaction benefits include faster checkout, improved accuracy, and enhanced customer satisfaction. On the other hand, [POS reconciliation benefits](https://cms.kredx.com/blog/pos-reconciliation-benefits) include identifying discrepancies, detecting fraud, and maintaining accurate financial records.

How  Does a POS Transaction Work?
---------------------------------

A POS transaction, or point of sale transaction, follows a series of steps to complete a purchase or sale. Here’s how a typical POS transaction works:

#### Item Selection

The customer selects the desired items or services from the business’s inventory. This can be done by physically choosing items in a store or by adding them to a virtual cart in an online or mobile application.

#### Pricing and Total Calculation

The POS system calculates the total amount based on the prices of the selected items, taking into account any applicable taxes, discounts, or promotions. It ensures accurate pricing and provides a clear breakdown of the costs.

#### Payment Method Selection

The customer chooses their preferred payment method, such as cash, credit or debit card, mobile wallet, or other electronic payment options. [Accounts payable](https://cms.kredx.com/accounts-payable/) and POS transactions work hand in hand as the latter generates invoices for goods or services purchased, while the former is responsible for recording and managing the payment obligations associated with those transactions, ensuring accurate financial records and timely payments.

#### Payment Processing

The chosen payment method is processed through the POS system. If it’s a card payment, the system may prompt the customer to swipe, dip, or tap their card on a card reader, or enter card details manually. For cash payments, the cashier collects the cash and provides change if necessary.

#### Authorization and Verification

The POS system authorizes the payment by verifying the payment details and confirming that sufficient funds are available. This step ensures the payment is legitimate and can be processed.

#### Transaction Completion

Once the payment is authorized, the transaction is considered complete. The POS system generates a receipt that includes details of the purchase, payment method, and any necessary business information. The receipt can be provided in physical or electronic form, depending on the business’s setup.

#### Inventory and Sales Updates

Simultaneously, the POS system updates the business’s inventory records, deducting the sold items from the available stock. It also records the transaction as a sale, which contributes to sales reporting and business analytics.

Throughout the process, the POS system ensures accuracy, security, and efficiency in handling transactions, providing a seamless checkout experience for customers and facilitating essential financial and inventory management for the business.

What are the Different Types of POS Transactions?
-------------------------------------------------

POS transactions can encompass various payment methods and types, catering to different customer preferences and business needs. Here are some of the common types of POS transactions:

#### Credit and Debit Card Transactions:

Customers purchase goods and services using credit and debit cards. A card is swiped, dipped, or tapped on a card reader, and a payment processor processes the transaction.

#### Contactless Payments (NFC):

Near Field Communication (NFC) technology enables contactless payments, which customers can make by simply touching their contactless-capable cards or mobile devices (such as smartphones or smartwatches) on the card reader.

#### Mobile Wallet Transactions:

Customers can make payments using mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay by securely saving their credit card information on their smartphones or other mobile devices. NFC technology is often used to accomplish these transactions.

#### Gift Card and Loyalty Program Transactions:

Customers can use gift cards or redeem points from loyalty programs to pay for their purchases. The POS system verifies and deducts the appropriate amount from the gift card balance or loyalty program account.

#### Cash Transactions:

Traditional cash transactions involve customers paying for their purchases with physical currency. Cash is tendered, and change may be provided if necessary.

#### Split Payments:

In some cases, customers may choose to split their payment between multiple methods. For example, they can pay a portion of the amount with cash and the remainder with a credit card or mobile wallet.

#### Offline Transactions:

In situations where there is limited or no internet connectivity, POS systems can support offline transactions. These transactions are stored locally and processed once the connection is restored.

To cater to a wide range of consumer preferences and payment methods, businesses may provide a combination of these transaction types.

Understanding and supporting a variety of transaction types helps increase customer convenience, increase the effectiveness of payment processing, and adapt to the changing world of digital payments.

How are POS Transactions Handled in a Business?
-----------------------------------------------

POS transactions are handled in a business through a combination of hardware, software, and operational processes. Here’s a breakdown of how POS transactions are typically managed:

#### POS System Setup:

A business sets up a POS system, which includes hardware components like a cash register, barcode scanner, card reader, receipt printer, and potentially additional peripherals based on the business’s needs. The system is connected to a computer or tablet running POS software.

#### Item Selection and Scanning:

Customers choose the goods or services they want to buy. Items may have barcodes attached to them in a [retail environment](https://www.gensler.com/blog/4-considerations-for-the-new-retail-environment) that may be read by a barcode scanner. The item information, including the description, price, and inventory data, are retrieved by the POS system.

#### Pricing and Total Calculation:

The POS system calculates the total amount based on the prices of the selected items, considering any applicable taxes, discounts, or promotions. It ensures accurate pricing and provides a clear breakdown of costs to the customer.

#### Payment Processing:

The customer selects their preferred payment method (credit card, debit card, cash, mobile wallet, etc.) after the total has been calculated. By corresponding with the relevant payment processor or gateway to authorize the payment, the POS system streamlines the payment processing procedure. The customer may need to swipe, insert, or touch their card on the card reader in order to complete a transaction using it. The cashier is in charge of taking cash payments.

#### Authorization and Verification:

The payment processor verifies the payment details, including card information, available funds, or payment authentication for mobile wallets. The POS system communicates with the processor to confirm the transaction’s authorization or decline it based on the response received.

#### Transaction Completion and Receipt Generation:

Upon successful payment authorization, the POS system generates a receipt. This can be provided in physical form, printed by a receipt printer, or in electronic form, sent via email or SMS. The receipt includes transaction details, such as items purchased, payment method, date, time, and any applicable discounts or loyalty points earned.

#### Invoice Discounting:

A business can acquire rapid funds through the financial practice of [invoice discounting](https://www.kredx.com/working-capital/invoice-discounting) by selling its accounts receivable (invoices) to a financial institution or a specialized lender. The lender gives the company an upfront advance of a portion of the invoice amount (often between 80 and 90 percent), less a discount or charge. The obligation to obtain payment from clients remains with the business. Businesses can increase cash flow, close the payment gap between issuing and receiving invoices, and preserve a stable [working capital](https://www.kredx.com/supply-chain-finance/working-capital/working-capital-loan) position with the aid of invoice discounting.

#### Inventory Management and Sales Reporting:

Simultaneously, the POS system updates the business’s inventory records, deducting the sold items from the available stock. This helps in maintaining accurate inventory levels and triggering reordering when necessary. The transaction data is also captured for sales reporting purposes, providing insights into revenue, popular items, and customer purchasing trends.

#### Security and Compliance:

Businesses implement security measures to protect customer payment data and ensure compliance with industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This includes encrypting sensitive data, securely storing transaction information, and adhering to best practices for data protection.

Efficient handling of POS transactions requires well-trained staff who can operate the POS system effectively, assist customers with payments, and provide excellent customer service. Regular monitoring and maintenance of the POS system are essential to ensure optimal performance and minimize disruptions during transactions.

By effectively managing POS transactions, businesses can streamline their checkout processes, accurately track sales and inventory, and provide a seamless experience for customers, contributing to overall operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
